# CartPole Reinforcement Learning using PPO

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to solve the **CartPole-v1** environment from Gymnasium using the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm provided by Stable-Baselines3.

The agent is trained to balance a pole on a moving cart by learning the optimal actions through reinforcement learning. After training, the model is evaluated and tested in a rendered simulation.

## Requirements

* Python 3.12
* Gymnasium
* Stable-Baselines3
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

Install dependencies using:

## How to Run

### 1. Train the Agent

```bash
python train.py
```

This generates:

* `ppo_model.zip`
* `learning_curve.png`

---

### 2. Evaluate the Model

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This generates:

* `evaluation_report.txt`

---

### 3. Test the Agent

```bash
python test.py
```

A simulation window will open showing the trained CartPole agent balancing the pole.
